Documentation     作为购书者，我希望得到免费快递，为了提高在线购书的积极性

...               As a book buyer, I want free delivery, so that I'll be more willing to buy

...               This test has a workflow similar to the keyword-driven
...               examples. The difference is that the keywords use higher
...               abstraction level and their arguments are embedded into
...               the keyword names.
...
...               This kind of _gherkin_ syntax has been made popular by
...               [http://cukes.info|Cucumber]. It works well especially when
...               tests act as examples that need to be easily understood also
...               by the business people.
